# Milestone Audit — v1.0

## Summary
All v1 requirements mapped in REQUIREMENTS.md are satisfied and every phase includes a passed VERIFICATION.md. Cross‑phase flows are wired and consistent based on code review. Minor tech‑debt items remain (notification reschedule duplication risk, documentation drift, and missing device QA).

## Requirements Coverage (v1)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| BRAND-01 | satisfied | Phase 01 verification (branding + metadata) |
| CONTENT-01 | satisfied | Phase 01 verification (renamed practices) |
| CONTENT-02 | satisfied | Phase 01 verification (original scripts) |
| ONBOARD-01 | satisfied | Phase 01 verification (mentor framing) |
| SCHED-01 | satisfied | Phase 02 verification (default 6‑week) |
| SCHED-02 | satisfied | Phase 02 verification (open training) |
| SCHED-03 | satisfied | Phase 02 verification (manual selection) |
| SCHED-04 | satisfied | Phase 02 verification (extended 8‑week) |
| FEED-01 | satisfied | Phase 03 verification (daily survey) |
| FEED-02 | satisfied | Phase 03 verification (lapse count) |
| METRIC-01 | satisfied | Phase 03 verification (longest interval) |
| METRIC-02 | satisfied | Phase 03 verification (session minutes/reps) |
| REVIEW-01 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification (minutes) |
| REVIEW-02 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification (longest interval) |
| REVIEW-03 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification (lapses) |
| REVIEW-04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification (journal highlights) |
| REVIEW-05 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification (recommendation) |
| NOTIF-01 | satisfied | Phase 05 verification (weekly reminder) |
| NOTIF-02 | satisfied | Phase 05 verification (daily reminder) |
| PLATFORM-01 | satisfied* | Code review only; no device QA run |
| PRIV-01 | satisfied | Local storage only; no network dependencies |

\* Platform QA pending device smoke tests.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| 01 Rebrand + Content | passed | 01-VERIFICATION.md |
| 02 Schedule Control | passed | 02-VERIFICATION.md |
| 03 Feedback & Metrics | passed | 03-VERIFICATION.md |
| 04 Weekly Review | passed | 04-VERIFICATION.md |
| 05 Notifications | passed | 05-VERIFICATION.md |

## Cross‑Phase Integration (Manual)

- **Onboarding → MainTabs**: Navigation routes intact.
- **Practice → Session Check‑In → Journal**: Session completion routes through check‑in, then journal.
- **Progress → Weekly Review**: Progress tab exposes weekly review CTA; weekly review screen exists.
- **Settings → Notifications**: Weekly reminder toggle and scheduling helpers connected.

## Tech Debt & Follow‑Ups

1. **Weekly reminder reschedule duplication**
   - Changing weekly reminder day/time schedules a new weekly reminder without canceling the prior one.
   - Fix: call cancelWeeklyReminder before scheduling a new weekly reminder.

2. **Decision drift in PROJECT.md**
   - PROJECT.md still states “weekly summary only (no daily reminders in v1)” but daily reminders are present.
   - Fix: update decision or remove daily reminder if not desired.

3. **Device QA**
   - No device smoke tests for iOS/Android (push notification permission flows and local notifications not validated).
   - Fix: run a basic device QA checklist.

4. **Documentation drift**
   - PROJECT.md Active requirements list is not updated to reflect completion.
   - Fix: update Active list or mark as complete.

## Audit Result
**Status: tech_debt** — Requirements satisfied and flows wired; minor follow‑ups remain before final sign‑off.
