# Phase 03 Research — Feedback & Metrics Capture

## Summary

Short, daily self‑report items are widely used to track attention and affect without heavy burden. For Focus Reps, a 4‑item post‑session survey (focus quality, mood, stress, energy) plus lapse count and longest uninterrupted interval can align with established constructs while remaining lightweight.

## Evidence Snapshot

### 1) Attention / awareness
- The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is a validated measure of attention to present‑moment experience and can inspire concise daily focus‑quality items. Source: UPenn Positive Psychology Center. citeturn0search4

### 2) Stress
- The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a validated global measure of perceived stress; short forms (e.g., PSS‑4) exist for lightweight tracking. Source: NIH / NCI. citeturn0search6

### 3) Mood / affect
- PANAS and short PANAS forms are validated measures of positive/negative affect. For a lightweight daily check‑in, we can use a single 1–5 mood rating informed by PANAS constructs. Source: ANU repository (short PANAS). citeturn1search3

### 4) Energy / alertness
- The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) is a simple 1–9 self‑report for sleepiness/alertness, which can map to an “energy” rating. Source: PubMed article referencing KSS. citeturn1search6

### 5) Lapses / mind wandering
- The Mind‑Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ) provides a validated way to assess attentional lapses, supporting our use of a simple lapse‑count estimate after sessions. Source: Frontiers in Psychology. citeturn0search2

## Implications for Phase 03

- **Daily survey should be minimal**: 4 items (focus quality, mood, stress, energy) rated 1–5 to reduce friction.
- **Lapse tracking can be two‑layered**:
  - **During session**: optional “Mark lapse” button to capture intervals.
  - **Post‑session**: a quick estimate to keep parity with MWQ‑style self‑report.
- **Longest uninterrupted interval** can be derived from the in‑session lapse events (max gap between lapses).

## Design Guidance

- Use short labels, 1–5 scale with anchors (e.g., Focus: “scattered → steady”).
- Store all metrics locally (no account), attached to each PracticeSession.
- Keep journal entry separate but linkable for weekly review.
