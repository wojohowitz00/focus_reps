# Phase 04 Research — Weekly Review & Recommendations

## Summary

Weekly summaries should focus on a small number of core metrics, highlight wins, and offer a single next-step recommendation. For Focus Reps, the minimal weekly review can combine total minutes, longest uninterrupted interval, lapse trends, and journal highlights. Recommendations can be heuristic (e.g., if lapse count rises, increase Anchor Breath frequency) without requiring complex ML.

## Evidence Snapshot

- Behavior change research suggests feedback should be timely, specific, and actionable to support adherence (Fogg Behavior Model and related habit literature). Weekly cadence is common for reflection without daily overload. citeturn2search1
- In mindfulness programs, reflective journaling supports engagement and awareness; highlighting entries helps reinforce practice meaning. citeturn2search2

## Implications for Phase 04

- **Weekly review should be concise**: 3–5 metrics max.
- **Recommendation should be singular**: “Do Anchor Breath 3x next week” instead of multi-step plans.
- **Journal highlights**: select 2–3 most recent entries or user-tagged highlights.

## Suggested Metrics

- Total focus minutes (sum duration)
- Longest uninterrupted interval (max longestFocusIntervalSec)
- Lapses per session (mean)
- Journaling highlights (most recent entries)
- Recommended next practice (simple heuristic)

## Recommendation Heuristics (Simple Rules)

1. If longest interval < 2 min or lapseCount average high → recommend Anchor Breath.
2. If lapses decreasing and intervals improving → suggest Thought Traffic or Body Sweep.
3. If mood/stress ratings are low/high → suggest Kindness Circuit.
