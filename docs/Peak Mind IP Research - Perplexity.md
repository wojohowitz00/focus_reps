# could you check whether peak Mind has been trademarked by amishi jha. Also, does she have any commercial projects associated with this?

Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about Peak Mind trademark and Dr. Amishi Jha's commercial ventures.

## Trademark Status and Commercial Ventures for "Peak Mind" and Dr. Amishi Jha

### Peak Mind Trademark Registration

The trademark "PEAK MIND" is currently registered to **Michael Trainer**, not Dr. Amishi Jha. The registration details are:[^1]

- **Registration Number**: 5045402
- **Serial Number**: 86907965
- **Owner**: Michael Trainer (individual)
- **Status**: Registered

Michael Trainer is a separate entrepreneur and social entrepreneur who operates a media platform and podcast called "Peak Mind" (also referred to as "RESONANCE"). His work focuses on connecting thought leaders with communities and features interviews with experts in human optimization, neuroscience, and performance. Trainer co-created the Global Citizen Festival and has been involved in various social impact initiatives.[^2][^3][^4][^5]

### Dr. Amishi Jha's Trademark Filings

While Dr. Jha does not own the "PEAK MIND" trademark, she has filed for at least one other trademark:

- **MBAT (Mindfulness-Based Attention Training)**: Jha has a trademark application for "MBAT" which covers printed books in the field of meditation, focus, performance, and mental skills.[^6]


### Dr. Amishi Jha's Commercial Projects

Despite not owning the "Peak Mind" trademark, Dr. Jha has successfully used the "Peak Mind" name for her book and has developed several commercial ventures:

#### 1. **Peak Mind Book (2021)**

Dr. Jha published her national bestseller *Peak Mind: Find Your Focus, Own Your Attention, Invest 12 Minutes a Day* through HarperCollins in October 2021. The book translates her neuroscience research into practical mindfulness training techniques and has received widespread acclaim.[^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12]

#### 2. **Peak Mind Interactive, LLC**

Dr. Jha founded **Peak Mind Interactive, LLC (PMI)**, a company dedicated to providing research-backed mindfulness training solutions.[^13][^14]

**Corporate Structure:**

- **Incorporation**: Registered as a Florida Limited Liability Company[^15][^16]
- **Document Number**: L22000013723
- **EIN**: 87-4416184
- **Principal**: Dr. Amishi Jha serves as Principal and Creative Director[^17]

**Mission**: PMI's stated mission is to "educate and train individuals, teams, and organizations with science-backed solutions to cultivate a peak mind".[^13]

#### 3. **Pushups for the Mind Mobile Application**

Peak Mind Interactive's flagship product is the **Pushups for the Mind** app, which represents a significant commercial venture with multiple revenue streams:

**Development \& Funding:**

- The app was developed through a two-year collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense[^18][^13]
- Funded by the Center for Traumatic Stress at the Uniformed Services University and the Henry Jackson Foundation[^19][^18]
- Co-led by Dr. Amy Adler (WRAIR senior scientist) and Col. Vincent Capaldi[^18]

**Product Offerings:**

The company has released two versions of the application:

**a) Pushups for the Mind.mil** (Military Version)

- **Launch Date**: May/June 2025[^20][^21][^18]
- **Target Audience**: U.S. military service members (active-duty, reserves, National Guard)[^22][^18]
- **Access**: Free for military personnel with .mil email addresses and students at military academies (West Point, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Army War College, Naval War College, National Defense University)[^22][^18]
- **Features**: 12 audio lessons, 4-week core training program, practice tracking, self-assessments[^23][^24][^18]

**b) Pushups for the Mind** (Civilian Version)

- **Launch Date**: October 2025 for Android, anticipated iOS release[^24]
- **Pricing**: One-time purchase (no subscription fees)[^24]
- **Target Audience**: General public, corporate clients, first responders, healthcare teams, athletes[^24]

**App Features:**

- 12 immersive audio lessons on attention and mindfulness
- Ramp-Up program (3- or 6-minute guided practices)
- 4-week Core Program with structured training
- Habit Support for sustained practice
- Progress tracking with visual charts
- Optional scientifically validated self-assessments
- Privacy-first design (no identifiable data collected, works offline)[^23][^18][^24]


#### 4. **Speaking Engagements**

Dr. Jha maintains an active speaking career as a significant revenue stream:

- **Speaking Fee Range**: \$30,000 - \$50,000 per engagement[^25]
- **Venues**: Has presented at TED, NATO, UK Parliament, Pentagon, World Economic Forum, corporate events[^10][^26][^27][^25]
- **Topics**: Attention training, mindfulness for high-performance, brain fitness, leadership development[^27][^28]


#### 5. **Corporate Training \& Facilitation**

Peak Mind Interactive is developing additional commercial offerings:

- **Facilitator Training Program**: In development to enable organizations to bring mindfulness training to their employees[^13]
- **Organizational Speaking Events**: Dr. Jha offers motivational keynote speeches for organizational events with "limited availability"[^13]
- **Research Partnerships**: Continues academic research funded by Department of Defense and private foundations[^29][^17][^13]


### Business Model \& Revenue Streams

Peak Mind Interactive operates with multiple revenue channels:

1. **App Sales**: One-time purchase for civilian version (pricing not publicly disclosed)
2. **Government Contracts**: DOD funding for military version development and distribution[^18][^13]
3. **Speaking Fees**: \$30,000-\$50,000 per keynote engagement[^25]
4. **Book Sales**: Ongoing royalties from HarperCollins publication[^30]
5. **Future Services**: Planned facilitator training and corporate training programs[^13]

### Key Distinctions

It's important to note the separation between entities:

- **Michael Trainer's "Peak Mind"**: Media platform, podcast, and registered trademark (Reg. No. 5045402) focused on interviewing thought leaders[^3][^1][^2]
- **Dr. Amishi Jha's "Peak Mind"**: Book title, company name (Peak Mind Interactive, LLC), and app brand focused on attention training and mindfulness based on neuroscience research[^7][^17][^13]

Despite the shared name, these appear to be separate ventures. Dr. Jha's use of "Peak Mind" for her book and company suggests either a licensing agreement, co-existence arrangement, or that the book title and commercial use falls outside the scope of Trainer's trademark registration (the specific goods/services covered by Trainer's trademark were not accessible in the search results).

### Future Trajectory

Peak Mind Interactive is positioned for growth:

- Planning public release of civilian app beyond initial military rollout[^21][^22]
- Expanding into corporate wellness and organizational training markets[^13]
- Developing facilitator certification programs[^13]
- Building on 25+ years of published research with high-stakes populations[^24][^18]

The company emphasizes its commitment to "scientific integrity," "privacy \& trust," and "accessibility \& impact" as core values, distinguishing itself from typical mindfulness apps through evidence-based approaches and military-validated training protocols.[^18][^13]
